Poshem Business School's CEO, Simon E. Akhamie has tasked the data analytics team with 
conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the company's sales dataset. The objective 
is to derive meaningful insights and patterns that can inform strategic decisions. The dataset 
comprises information on orders, customers, products, and shipping details.
At the end of the data analysis, the following insight was gotten based on the Business School Performance:


SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS

the average sales is 230.8 and most of the sales come from the south and east region
technology has the highest sales by product category
standard class has the highest patronage in all the regions


Actionable recommendations based on the analysis

since more sales come from Technology, more focus should be on it
standard class should be used in all the regions
more focus should be on office supllies
more focus should also be on New York
more focus should also be on the West region
For customer satisfaction, we recommend that products should be delivered on the first day or using either the first or the second class shipping more which took 2 to 3 days instead of using the standard class shipping mode which too 5 days to be delivered, and it was used for all the regions which can lead to customer dissatisfaction. This will encourage the customer to order more products where the delivery time is optimal.
